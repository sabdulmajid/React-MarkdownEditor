### Inspiration
This project was a simple idea that appeared to me when I was using the Devpost site (the markdown editor built-in to their site). 
### Uses
My main use of this project was to try to type code into the live markdown editor and see how it displayed. It made it much easier than just saving the Devpost work and re-editing it over and over again.
### How to use
Just head over to [the website](https://sabdulmajid.github.io/React-MarkdownEditor/) and start typing in Markdown!
### Made by
Me! With lots of love (and time!)
